A web-based recreation of my NMS Layline Calculator

I am very very new to web development (literally started learning yesterday) so bear with me 🙏 <br />
This may take a few weeks... or months idk

<h3>A few things to note:</h3>
- Firefox users might have to deal with a few bugs since there's some weird `-moz` stuff that I don't really want to deal with.
- Button animations don't work super well on mobile. I might get it figured out sometime but idk.
