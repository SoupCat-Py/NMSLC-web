*Note from the future:* I redid the entire thing lmao<br />
The CSS was terrible and the whole thing looked kind of bad so now it's better :D

<h3>A few things to note:</h3>
- Button animations don't work super well on mobile. I might get it figured out sometime but idk.<br />
- It kind of looks terrible on Safari lol
